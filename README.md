# Python_PY4E
This is a repository for all of the assignments that I completed in an effort to learn Python through the PY4E program, which I completed July 2023.

I have gone back into the files and added in the instructions provided upon assignment of exercises to add better context and clarity. Additionally,
the files that are associated with the SQL exercises have been saved to a separate folder for organizational purposes.
